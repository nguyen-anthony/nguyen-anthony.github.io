      <description>Breaks    I&amp;rsquo;ve worked 5 weeks in a row so far with no days off. My full-time job is as a software engineer, but I work a part-time job every other weekend at an apartment complex as a leasing agent. I have not had a day off since March 14th, 2022. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty tired.
Why two jobs?    I don&amp;rsquo;t need the money. It is nice to have additional income, but I do not need it.</description>

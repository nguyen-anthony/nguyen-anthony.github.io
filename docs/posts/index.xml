      <description>Breaks    I&amp;rsquo;ve worked 5 weeks in a row so far with no days off. My full-time job is as a software engineer, but I work a part-time job every other weekend at an apartment complex as a leasing agent. I have not had a day off since March 14th, 2022. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty tired.
Why two jobs?    I don&amp;rsquo;t need the money. It is nice to have additional income, but I do not need it.</description>

      <description>My First Blog Post    I decided to go with building my personal site and portfolio with gohugo.io. I discovered Hugo during my time on the Technology Leadership Program at Target Corporation. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to setup, uses GoLang to render all of the pages. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m sticking with pre-designed theme for now since this will mostly be just for me. However, I do want to explore building my own layouts one day.</description>

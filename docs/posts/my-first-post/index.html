<p>I decided to go with building my personal site and portfolio with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">gohugo.io</a>.
I discovered Hugo during my time on the Technology Leadership Program at Target Corporation.
It&rsquo;s very easy to setup, uses GoLang to render all of the pages. Right now I&rsquo;m sticking with pre-designed theme for now since this will mostly be just for me. <strong>However, I do want to explore building my own layouts one day.</strong></p>

<p>For details, TLP is a program at Target Corporation is for newer/recent collegiate graduates to be introduced into tech world. My first rotation is on a team called Measurement, which ingests and partitions a lot of data for a lot of the company and makes it usable.</p>
<p>My experience so far has been amazing but overwhelming to say the least. It uses GoLang which I&rsquo;ve never actually used before joining this team. It also uses things like Elasticsearch, which I still don&rsquo;t fully understand after being on the team for two months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned pretty quickly that no one ever actually fully understands what&rsquo;s going on, but knows enough to get by.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am learning a lot about the life of an engineer. There&rsquo;s more research involved than I ever anticipated. I&rsquo;d say so far it&rsquo;s about 25% actually writing code, 30% doing research, and 45% having design and solution discussions. But that&rsquo;s just after a few months in my first rotation. Maybe things will change in a few months.</p>

  Leaving Best Buy

</h2>
<p>I spent 8.5 years of my adult life at the same company. Granted 4 years was working in the stores and 4.5 years were at the corporate office/magic castle. But I learned <strong>A LOT</strong> about corporate life there. I had great mentors and truly felt like I was part of a family. I do miss them, it&rsquo;s hard to leave a company after so many years. Not so much about the company itself, but the people that I worked along with for so long that I could truly call my friends. I can definitely see myself going back one day and I wouldn&rsquo;t regret it. I do not regret my decision to leave Best Buy to start my engineering career, but I know I miss that culture extremely.</p>
